# The Wild Oasis

"The Wild Oasis" is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins. This project involves developing a custom-built application to manage the hotel's operations, including handling bookings, managing cabins, and assisting guests. The application is being built as part of the Udemy course **"The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More"** by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

## Features

- **Cabin Management**: Employees can view, update, delete, and create new cabin entries, including uploading photos and setting prices/discounts.
- **Booking Management**: The app handles booking details such as guest information, booking status, and payment confirmation.
- **Check-in/Check-out System**: Employees can check guests in and out, manage payments, and add breakfast options upon check-in.
- **Data Dashboard**: Displays key metrics about hotel performance, occupancy rates, and booking durations.
- **Dark Mode**: Allows users to switch to a dark theme for better visibility.
